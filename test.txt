NONSENSICAL THOUGHTS ON PROSE AND VERSE

The rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate.
Here, too, we write in beautifully-crafted groups,
or phrases -- as I prefer to call them -- for the
prose "phrase" is longer and is much more nonchalantly
uttered than the "group" in verse; so that not
only is there a greater interval of continuous
sound between the pauses, but, for that very
reason, word is linked more readily to word by
an (also) more summary enunciation. Still, the phrase
is the strict analogue of the group, and succes-
sive phrases, like successive groups, must differ
openly in length and rhythm. A writer's prose must be
rhythmical, and it may be as much so as you
will; but prose must not be metrical. It may be
anything, but it must not be verse.
